# Web Development Internship Project

I have completed my 2nd project of:

# E-Commerce Website
Author - Aashish Kumar

This project is a minimalist daily planner application, meticulously crafted using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It represents a significant learning outcome from my web development internship at Brainwave Matrix Solutions. Through its development, I focused on:

Strengthening foundational HTML for semantic structure. Mastering CSS for modern and responsive design principles. Implementing JavaScript for interactive features like task management (add, edit, delete) and local storage integration for data persistence. This application serves as a testament to practical front-end development skills gained during the internship, emphasizing clean code and user experience.

# Key Features : Creates by using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Fully Responsive. Animated Modern Design.
I'm glad to do Internship with Brainwave Matrix Solutions and giving me this opportunity to show my creative skills.
